## 🚀 Career Shift Into Networking

I’m transitioning from a broader engineering background into a full-time **Network Engineering** role.  
My hands-on project experience covers:

- Multi-site hybrid networks (HQ + Branches)
- Cisco switching/routing, VLAN segmentation, STP hardening
- FortiGate NGFW, IPsec ADVPN, Remote Access VPN
- OSPF, iBGP, SD-WAN with SLA-based traffic steering
- RADIUS (FreeRADIUS on Ubuntu), SNMP, syslog logging, Zabbix monitoring

🛠 I built, tested, and documented everything myself in PNETLab with real config files, policy JSONs, and verification steps.
